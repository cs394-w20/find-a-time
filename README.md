## Find a Time

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Standards
Make sure to update this README with any standards that all of the team members must follow!

- Use Material-UI for all styling
- Create pull requests (PR) for all commits
- Create branches with the following style: `issueNumber-featureName`
- Send a detailed status update to the #find-a-time Slack channel after every team meeting, so that members who did not attend are on the same page.
- Create an issue for every task that you must complete, and assign yourself to one. We are now using Github issues to track our progress instead of Trello.
